What is one major advantage of using an object instead of multiple variables?
A major advantage is modularity. By calling out functions to different phases of the code you can make a program modular and more organized.
This will help when trying to reuse codes, edit part of the code, or organize it in a better way. 

What is the role of the parameters of a function?
Variable that are local to a funcntion, this means declaring a variable to a parameter, which is the function. The variable within the parameter need an initial value, this is placed when you call the function to perform the program.
This are called arguments, the arguments define the parameters within a function.
The role of parameters is to give variations to a function without hving to rewrite the function. For example drawing the same flower multiple times but variating the location, or the number o petals, or both. 

What does it mean for a function to "return" something?
When a function stops repeating it iwlll evaluat and give a number or a new value. So to return something it means that the fucntion will retun a new value from its parameters and arguments.
Fir example: the conversion of measurements.
Return means it wil evaluate the function and give me an answer on my parameters and values.
